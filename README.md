#The devised methods functions and our simulations are prepared as follows:
\
\
\>> image joint histogram or 2D histogram; MATLAB function: imhist2D.m
\
\
\>> IR: image local feature points count; MATLAB function: ir.m
\
\
\>> MIR: match local feature points count over two given frames; MATLAB function: mir.m
\
\
\>> the lower bound on IR (LIR); MATLAB function: lir.m
\
\
\>> the lower bound on MIR (LMIR); MATLAB function: lmir.m
\
\
\>> contiguous intensity merging for 1D histogram; MATLAB function: bincom.m
\
\
\>> contiguous intensity merging for 2D histogram; MATLAB function: bincom2D.m
\
\
\>> image entropy and image mutual information; MATLAB function: ShEntropy.m & mutualInf.m
\
\
\>>The IR-based Optimization method: MATLAB function: Koptimizer.m
