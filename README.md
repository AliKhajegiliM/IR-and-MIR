# IR-and-MIR
The Information &amp; Mutual Information Ratio: To Count Image Local Features and Their Matches
\
1-The mathematical proofs of article theoremes, corollaries, and lemmas
\
2-The functions of the devised method and our simulations are as follows 
\
\>> image joint histogram or 2D histogram: MATLAB function
\
\>> IR: image local feature points count: MATLAB function 
\
\>> MIR: match local feature points count over two given frames: MATLAB function
\
\>> contiguous intensity histogram merging, varying feature distance: MATLAB function
\
\>> image entropy and image mutual information: MATLAB function
\
\>> the lower bound of MIR and IR: MATLAB function
