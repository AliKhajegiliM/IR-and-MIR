\
#The functions of the devised method and our simulations are as follows 
\
\>> image joint histogram or 2D histogram; MATLAB function: imhist2D.m
\
\>> IR: image local feature points count: MATLAB function 
\
\>> MIR: match local feature points count over two given frames: MATLAB function
\
\>> contiguous intensity merging for 1D histogram; MATLAB function: bincom.m
\
\>> contiguous intensity merging for 2D histogram; MATLAB function: bincom2D.m
\
\>> image entropy and image mutual information; MATLAB function: ShEntropy.m & mutualInf.m
\
\>> the lower bound of MIR and IR: MATLAB function
\
\>>coming soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
